# A Neural Networks Modelling Tool

This project is a neural network modelling tool, developed as a bachelor's final project by Enrique Ortega Yegros for Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid. It includes several examples and the source code of the project, which was done using Sirius and Acceleo, Eclipse's plug-in. 

## Project Structure

- `examples/`: Contains the example neural networks models used in the project report.
- `src/`: Contains the source code of the project.
  - `my.project.design/`: Defines the Sirius' concrete syntax
  - `neuralnetwork/`, `neuralnetwork.edit/` and `neuralnetwork.editor/`: Define the project meta-model.
  - `org.eclipse.acceleo.module.sample/`: Contains the main entry point of the 'GenerateNeuralNetworkKeras' generation module.
  - `org.eclipse.acceleo.module.sample.ui/`: Contains the UI for the 'Neural Network in Keras' generation module.

## How to Use

1. Open the project in your Eclipse IDE.
2. Launch a new runtime from your Eclipse.
3. Create a new Modeling Project.
4. Create a new `neuralnetwork` model in your project's `representations.aird` clicking on Models &rarr; New... &rarr; Search for `neuralnetwork`.
5. Create a new representation of the model in your project's `representations.aird` clicking on Representations &rarr; New... &rarr; Your model.
6. Edit your models representation as you wish.
7. You can rigth-click in the represenation editor and validate your diagram.
8. When you are finished, rigth-click on your model's `.neuralnetwork` file and click on Acceleo Model to Text &rarr; Generate Neural Network in Keras.
9. Navigate to src-gen to see the results!
